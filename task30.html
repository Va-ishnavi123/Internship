            </h1>
            <p>DEMOCRATS Academy began its humble journey in the year 2000 under the able guidance of Director Mr. Danish Mansuri. Our idea of education is to unsettle the minds of the young and inflame their intellects. We have striven to evolve an educational environment that nurtures while teaching and encouraging the students to recognize their distinctive potential. We lay stress on grooming the children to be independent learner so they grow up to be leaders and decision makers. Our objective is not only to impart academic education but also to develop personality, physical growth, emotional & spiritual balance and imbibing pride in our cultural heritage.

<h1>ABOUT EDUCATION</h1>
<p>A school is an educational institution designed to provide learning spaces and learning environments for the teaching of students under the direction of teachers. Most countries have systems of formal education, which is sometimes compulsory.In these systems, students progress through a series of schools. The names for these schools vary by country (discussed in the Regional terms section below) but generally include primary school for young children and secondary school for teenagers who have completed primary education. An institution where higher education is taught, is commonly called a university college or university. In addition to these core schools, students in a given country may also attend schools before and after primary (elementary in the U.S.) and secondary (middle school in the U.S.) education.
